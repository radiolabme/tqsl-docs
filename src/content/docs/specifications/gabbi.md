## Discussion

A basic philosophy guiding data interchange is: "Be conservative in what you generate; be liberal in what you accept." Following this precept, the affirmative obligation falls upon the sender to covert data, which may be stored in a local or proprietary format, into the specified format for interchange prior to transmission to the recipient.

Thus, one will find in this document that the strictest requirements for formatting and content are levied upon the GAbbI writer. A GAbbI reader on the other hand, is allowed to be more tolerant and less absolutist when applying these rules and deciding what constitutes valid data that it might be willing to accept.

The acceptance of non-compliant data is wholly at the discretion of the receiver. In addition to being liberal in what it accepts, a GAbbI reader would be well advised to also keep in mind another principle when deciding how to dispose of malformed fields and records: "First, do no harm."

## 1. Physical Specifications

### Files

- A logical file shall be composed of a header area and a data area.
- The header area shall proceed the data area.
- The header area shall consist of zero or more records and be terminated by an end of header tag.
- The data area shall consist of zero or more records and be terminated by an end of file tag.

### Records

- Records shall be composed of zero or more fields.
- Records shall be separated by record separator tags.

### Character Set

- The "character set" shall be ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 UCS ("Unicode Version 3.0")
- Default encoding of characters shall be UTF-8
- Readers may support UTF-16 encoding [TBR]
  - A GAbbI file object that is encoded in UTF-16 shall begin with a two octet signature of #xFEFF (Zero Width No-Break Space; Byte Order Mark)
- A compliant GAbbI reader shall check for the BOM signature. If the BOM signature is encountered indicating that the following file object is UTF-16 encoded and the reader cannot process UTF-16, the reader shall generate a fatal error

### Fields

```
<Field_Name:Field_Length[:Field_Type]>Field_Value
```

_Example:_ `<Call:4>K1MK`

**Field_Name** — A sequence of one (1) to thirty-two (32) [TBR] characters from the set: `[A-Za-z0-9/.?_+:=!@#$%^&*-]` [TBR]. In determining equivalence and uniqueness Field_Names shall be treated as case insensitive, i.e. `CALL`, `call`, `Call` and `CaLl` are equivalent Field_Names.

Use of Field*Names beginning with the character sequences `GABBI*`and`SIGN\_` shall be reserved for use in the specification. All other legal Field_Names may be used for local field definitions created by users.

**Field_Length** — Specification of the length of Field_Value in Unicode characters (not bytes or octets and not symbols or graphemes). The specification is a non-negative decimal integer with no leading zeros and shall be constructed from the characters `[0-9]`.

**Field_Type** — (Optional) A specification of the type of the field value. Treated as case insensitive.

**Field_Value** — A sequence of Field_Length characters that represents the value of the field.

### Separator Tags

As with field names, separator tags shall be treated as case insensitive.

**`<eoh>`** — End of header area. `<eoh>` shall be present in every GAbbI file object. `<eoh>` signals the end of the header area and start of the data area.

**`<eor>`** — End of physical record.

**`<eof>`** — End of logical file. `<eof>` shall be present in every GAbbI file object. `<eof>` signals the end of the data area. Upon encountering `<eof>` a GAbbI reader shall reset its internal state; a new GAbbI header may follow immediately (or physical EOF may follow).

## 3. Field Definitions

### tCERT (Identity certificate) Record

Each GAbbI file shall contain at least one tCERT record.

### tCONTACT (Trusted Contact) Record

The tCONTACT record contains information that is unique to a specific contact. Note that most of the fields are required. This is because these fields can be expected to differ for each contact.

For the sake of transmission and reception efficiency, the information that is shared in common by several contacts is grouped together and placed into a tSTATION record. The information contained in the tSTATION record is included in the virtual QSL record by means of the STATION_GUID field. Each GAbbI file shall contain at least one tCONTACT record.

| Name           | Type | Required | Category  | Max Size (chars) | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| FREQ           | F    | N        |           | 8                | Frequency. Describes a two-way (non-crossband) contact[³]. Format for interchange shall be frequency in MHz with no greater than 100 mHz precision. A decimal point shall be included. There shall be no leading zeros; there shall be no trailing zeroes after the last significant digit. If the precise frequency is unknown use the Frequency listed in Table 1 for the band may be used. |

### tSTATION (Trusted Station) Record

The tSTATION record contains information that is common to a set of logical QSL records; each logical QSL record provides the trusted (signed) set of information needed to confirm a QSO. Each GAbbI file shall contain at least one tSTATION record

When a field appears in a tSTATION record, it specifies the default value for the field in each logical record, which references a tSTATION record via the STATION_GUID field. In constructing the logical QSL record from the tSTATION and tCONTACT records, the order of precedence shall be: appearance of a field in the tCONTACT record will supersede any default value for that field that may have been established by the appearance of the same field in the linked tSTATION record.

| tHEADER  | This indicates a logical header record. This record shall be placed in the header area preceding the `<eoh>` tag.                                                                                                                         |
| tSTATION | This record contains the common information describing a series of QSOs. Typically, this is information that describes the sender and his/her station. All tSTATION records shall be placed in the header area preceding the `<eoh>` tag. |
| QSO      | This is also the standard logbook format. All QSO records shall be in the data area, following the `<eoh>` tag. To maintain backward compatibility, this is the default record type.                                                      |

### Categories

Implicit rules are associated with some fields; at least one extra parameter (in addition to Type, Signed, Required & Maximum Size) must be provided in order to specify fields that fall into these categories:

| Name      | Super-Category       | Sub-Category | Parameters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sub_Gov2  | Sub_Gov1             | Sub_Gov3     | If a field in the Sub_Gov2 category is of Enumeration (E) type, a list of the enumerated values shall be provided. Each enumerated value for a field in the Sub_Gov2 category shall be associated with an enumerated value in a field of the superior category (Sub_Gov1).      |
| Sub_Gov3  | Sub_Gov2 or Sub_Gov1 | —            | If a field in the Sub_Gov3 category is of Enumeration (E) type, a list of the enumerated values shall be provided. Each enumerated value for a field in the Sub_Gov3 category shall be associated with an enumerated value in field of a super-category (Sub_Gov2 or Sub_Gov1). |
| Signature | —                    | —            | A specific signing rule (which fields are signed; in what order do fields appear) must be specified.                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Sub_Gov1, Sub_Gov2 & Sub_Gov3

The fields which describe administrative subdivisions constitute an implicit hierarchy beginning at the level of DXCC entity:

```
+---DXCC
    +---Sub_Gov1
           |
           +---Sub_Gov2
                  |
                  +---Sub_Gov3
```

If a GAbbI writer specifies the value for a field from the "Sub_Gov" hierarchy, the writer shall also specify a fully consistent set of values for all the superior fields in the hierarchy up to and including DXCC entity.

A reader shall treat the appearance of a single field from the "Sub_Gov" hierarchy as an implicit specification of a value for each of the superior fields in the hierarchy up to and including DXCC entity. E.g., `US_COUNTY == HI001` (Hawaii County) should be interpreted by a reader as specifying `SUB_GOV1 == US-HI` (State of Hawaii) and `DXCC == 110` (Hawaii) in addition to the county; and `JP_CITY == 2701` (Kobe) should be read as specifying `SUB_GOV1 == JP-28` (Hyôgo Prefecture) and `DXCC == 339` (Japan) in addition to the city. When more than one field in the "Sub_Gov" hierarchy appears in a record, the values specified implicitly and explicitly at every level of the hierarchy shall be identical. In the event an inconsistency amongst the fields of the "Sub_Gov" hierarchy is detected, the reader shall issue an error message and may discard the record.

The values of the SUB*GOV2 and SUB_GOV3 fields are non-enumerated character strings. Enumerations for administrative subdivisions below the top-level are typically not found in standardized sources such as ISO 3166-2 and FIPS Pub. 10-4. Field which are members of category Sub_Gov2 and category Sub_Gov3 and which have an enumerated field value shall have a uniquely distinguished field name that shall begin with the ISO 3166-1:1997 alpha-2 (two-letter) code element followed by an underscore ("*").

## Footnotes

[1] Illegal characters encountered while scanning a field are to be ignored. The field length shall be interpreted as the number of valid characters to be read. If while scanning a field, the reader encounters an illegal character other than an end-of-line character (`<CR>` or `<NL>`), the reader shall issue a warning. If a start of field delimiter '<' is encountered before the expected end of field, the reader shall reject the field being read and issue a warning.

_N.B.:_ GAbbI is only weakly armored against line folding and provides no protection at all against gratuitous character re-mapping that can be introduced by the transport layer, especially e-mail. A prudent precaution would be to encode a GAbbI object using base64 prior to transport via e-mail. This encoding is mandatory if UTF-8 characters beyond the 7-bit ASCII character set are to be exchanged.

[2] To indicate a cross-band contact the pair of fields: BAND_RX and BAND_TX shall be used. If the BAND field appears in a record then neither BAND_RX nor BAND_TX may appear. If either the BAND_RX or BAND_TX field appears, then both fields must appear.

[3] To indicate a split-frequency contact the pair of fields: FREQ_RX and FREQ_TX shall be used. If the FREQ field appears in a record then neither FREQ_RX nor FREQ_TX may appear. If either the FREQ_RX or FREQ_TX field appears, then both fields must appear. All cross-band contacts are split-frequency; not every split-frequency contact is crossband.

[4] To indicate a cross-mode contact the pair of fields: MODE_RX and MODE_TX shall be used. If the MODE field appears in a record then neither MODE_RX nor MODE_TX may appear. If either the MODE_RX or MODE_TX field appears, then both fields must appear.

[5] A compliant GAbbI reader shall support SHA-1 message digest and RSA signatures. Readers may optionally support the MD5 message digest and/or DSA and ECDSA signatures. The GAbbI header declarations cue the reader on which algorithms will be used in the file. Which combination of digest and key type were actually used for a given signature is implicitly specified via the SIGN_XXX family of fields on a signature-by-signature basis. If a reader is presented with data signed using a public key algorithm that the reader does not support, the reader shall generate a fatal error.

[6] "Geographic location" should not correspond to a specific governmental or administrative subdivision such as a town or village. Location within an administrative subdivision should be indicated by use of one or more "SUB_GOV#" fields.

[7] If needed for an explicit declaration, the non-callsign value of "NONE" for REPEATER shall be permitted.

[8] Setting SAT_MODE equal to "EME" shall indicate an Earth-Moon-Earth (moonbounce) contact. The corresponding SAT_NAME shall be "MOON".

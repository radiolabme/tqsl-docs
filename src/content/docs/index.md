> Dedicated to keeping the technology for digitally signed eQSLs freely available to the amateur radio community

## Mission

The mission of the Trusted QSL Group is to keep eQSL an open and free activity for amateur radio operators by promoting the **Digital Signature Standard (DSS)**.

The Digital Signature Standard (DSS) specifies algorithms appropriate for applications requiring a digital, rather than written, signature. A digital signature is represented in a computer as a string of binary digits. A digital signature is computed using a set of rules and a set of parameters such that the identity of the signatory and integrity of the data can be verified. An algorithm provides the capability to generate and verify signatures.

## Goal

The goal of the Trusted QSL Group is to set the standards and create the necessary tools and software needed to implement the Trusted DSS model.

## Specifications

- [GAbbI (Global Amateur Interchange)](specifications/gabbi.md) - Specifications for amateur radio data interchange
- [ADIF (Amateur Data Interchange Format)](http://www.adif.org) - External specification
- [ARRL LoTW (Logbook of the World)](specifications/lotw.md) - ARRL specifications

## Current Implementation

The Trusted QSL software continues to be actively developed and maintained:

- **[Trusted QSL on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/trustedqsl/)** - Downloads, source code, and bug tracking
- **[ARRL Logbook of the World](https://lotw.arrl.org/)** - Official ARRL LoTW service
- **[Rick Murphy's LoTW Resources](https://www.rickmurphy.net/lotw/)** - Additional documentation and information

### Rick Murphy, K1MU

Special recognition to **Rick Murphy, K1MU**, the long-time maintainer of Trusted QSL and recipient of the **ARRL President's Award** for his exceptional contributions to amateur radio through his work on LoTW and TQSL. Rick's dedication to maintaining free and open tools for the amateur radio community has benefited countless operators worldwide. Thank you, Rick!

## Open Source License

Trusted QSL is licensed under the **BSD License**. The standards and source codes can be used freely as long as you do not attempt to prevent others from doing the same. This doesn't prevent logbook authors from using the libraries commercially—the only sources required to be released on demand would be the sources to the libraries themselves.

**Key Points:**

- Free to use, modify, and distribute
- Attribution required to ARRL and original authors
- No warranty provided
- Derivative works must preserve open source nature

See the [complete license text](reference/license.md) for full terms and conditions.
